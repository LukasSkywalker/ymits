   <plaintext>Infinity, most often denoted as infinity, is an unbounded quantity that is greater than every real number. The symbol infinity had been used as an alternative to M (1000) in Roman numerals until 1655, when John Wallis suggested it be used instead for infinity.
Infinity is a very tricky concept to work with, as evidenced by some of the counterintuitive results that follow from Georg Cantor&apos;s treatment of infinite sets.
Informally, 1/infinity = 0, a statement that can be made rigorous using the limit concept,
lim_(x-&gt;infinity) 1/x = 0
Similarly,
lim_(x-&gt;0^+) 1/x = infinity, where the notation 0^+ indicates that the limit is taken from the positive side of the real line.
In Mathematica, infinity is represented using the symbol Infinity.</plaintext>
